# ðŸ“· Camera Glitches Fix - Quick Solution

The camera glitching/black screen issue is caused by Flutter's Impeller rendering engine on some Android devices.

## âœ… Quick Fix Options

### Option 1: Disable Impeller (Recommended)

Add this to your `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` inside the `<application>` tag:

```xml
<application
    android:label="slid_controller"
    android:name="${applicationName}"
    android:icon="@mipmap/ic_launcher">
    
    <!-- Add this meta-data to disable Impeller -->
    <meta-data
        android:name="io.flutter.embedding.android.EnableImpeller"
        android:value="false" />
    
    <activity ...>
    ...
```

Then rebuild:
```bash
flutter clean
flutter run
```

### Option 2: Use Legacy Rendering (Alternative)

Run the app with this command:
```bash
flutter run --no-enable-impeller
```

### Option 3: Wait for Camera to Initialize

The code I just updated adds a 500ms delay before showing the camera, which helps with initialization. This should already be working better.

## ðŸ§ª Test After Fix

1. **Open the app**
2. **Tap QR scanner button**
3. **Wait 1-2 seconds** for camera to initialize
4. **Camera should show clear preview** (not glitchy/black)
5. **Point at QR code** to test scanning

## ðŸ“± Current Status

**What I Fixed:**
- âœ… Added proper controller initialization
- âœ… Added 500ms delay before camera starts
- âœ… Added loading indicator while initializing
- âœ… Set `BoxFit.cover` for better camera preview
- âœ… Limited formats to QR codes only (faster detection)
- âœ… Disabled return image (better performance)

**What You Need to Do:**
Choose one of the options above to disable Impeller rendering.

## ðŸ’¡ Why This Happens

The error `Invalid external texture` means Flutter's new Impeller rendering engine (introduced in Flutter 3.10+) has compatibility issues with camera textures on your device (Samsung Galaxy S9+).

**Impeller** is great for performance but still has bugs with:
- Camera previews on some devices
- External textures
- Samsung devices especially

**Solution**: Disable Impeller for now, or wait for Flutter updates to fix it.

## ðŸš€ After the Fix

Once Impeller is disabled, you should see:
- âœ… Smooth camera preview
- âœ… No black screens
- âœ… No glitches
- âœ… Fast QR code detection
- âœ… Clear video feed

**Try Option 1 first (disabling Impeller in manifest), it's the most permanent fix!**
