# Portrait Orientation Lock Test Guide

## What's Fixed

I've locked the Flutter app to portrait orientation only. The app will no longer rotate to landscape mode.

### **üéØ Changes Made:**
- **Portrait Only**: App locked to portrait up and portrait down
- **No Landscape**: Removed landscape left and landscape right orientations
- **Early Lock**: Orientation set in main() function for immediate effect
- **Persistent Lock**: Orientation preferences maintained throughout app lifecycle

## How It Works

### **üì± Orientation Settings:**
- **Portrait Up**: Normal portrait orientation
- **Portrait Down**: Upside-down portrait orientation
- **No Landscape**: App will not rotate to landscape mode
- **Locked**: Orientation cannot be changed by device rotation

### **üîß Technical Implementation:**
1. **Main Function**: Sets orientation preferences early in app startup
2. **Build Method**: Reinforces orientation preferences during app rebuilds
3. **SystemChrome**: Uses Flutter's system chrome to control orientation
4. **Persistent**: Orientation lock maintained throughout app usage

## Testing Steps

### **Step 1: Install and Run App**
1. **Build and install** the Flutter app on your device
2. **Launch the app** - should start in portrait mode
3. **Check initial orientation** - should be portrait

### **Step 2: Test Rotation Prevention**
1. **Rotate your device** to landscape mode
2. **App should NOT rotate** - stays in portrait
3. **Try rotating** in both directions (left and right)
4. **App should remain** in portrait orientation

### **Step 3: Test Portrait Upside-Down**
1. **Rotate device** to portrait upside-down
2. **App should rotate** to upside-down portrait
3. **This is allowed** - only landscape is blocked

### **Step 4: Test During Usage**
1. **Use the app normally** (connect to server, control slides)
2. **Try rotating device** while using the app
3. **App should stay** in portrait mode
4. **No landscape rotation** should occur

## Expected Behavior

### **‚úÖ What Should Happen:**
- App starts in portrait mode
- App stays in portrait when device rotates to landscape
- App can rotate to upside-down portrait
- Orientation lock is persistent throughout app usage
- No landscape mode at any time

### **‚ùå What Should NOT Happen:**
- App rotating to landscape mode
- App changing orientation when device rotates
- Landscape mode appearing during any app usage
- Orientation changes during slide control

## Troubleshooting

### **If app still rotates to landscape:**
- Make sure you've rebuilt and reinstalled the app
- Check that the changes were applied to main.dart
- Try restarting the app completely
- Check device settings for auto-rotation

### **If app doesn't start in portrait:**
- Check device orientation settings
- Make sure device is in portrait when launching app
- Try launching app from different orientations

### **If orientation changes during usage:**
- Check that both main() and build() methods have orientation settings
- Make sure SystemChrome.setPreferredOrientations is called
- Verify the app was properly rebuilt with changes

## What to Report

Please tell me:
1. **Does the app start** in portrait mode?
2. **Does the app stay** in portrait when you rotate to landscape?
3. **Can the app rotate** to upside-down portrait?
4. **Is the orientation lock** persistent during app usage?
5. **Are there any** orientation issues?

The app should now be locked to portrait orientation only! üì±üîí
