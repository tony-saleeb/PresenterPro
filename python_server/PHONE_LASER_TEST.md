# Phone-Controlled Laser Pointer Test Guide

## What's New

I've created a **PhoneLaserPointer** widget that should actually work with phone movement. Here's how to test it:

## Step 1: Start the Server

```bash
cd python_server
python slide_controller_server.py
```

**Expected**: Server starts and shows "Server started successfully!"

## Step 2: Setup PowerPoint

1. **Open PowerPoint**
2. **Start a presentation** (F5)
3. **Make sure PowerPoint window is active/focused**

## Step 3: Connect Flutter App

1. **Open Flutter app**
2. **Connect to your server IP** (not localhost)
3. **Tap "Start" to begin presentation**

## Step 4: Test Phone-Controlled Laser Pointer

You should now see a **"LASER POINTER"** section with:

### Status Display:
- Shows calibration status
- Shows ACTIVE/INACTIVE status
- Shows calibrated X,Y values

### Control Buttons:
- **CALIBRATE/RECALIBRATE**: Sets current phone position as center
- **Red Circle Button**: Hold to activate laser pointer
- **TEST**: Sends test positions to verify server communication

## Step 5: How to Use

1. **First, tap "CALIBRATE"** - this sets your current phone position as the center
2. **Hold the red circle button** - this activates the laser pointer
3. **Move your phone** - the laser should follow your phone movement
4. **Release the button** - this stops the laser pointer

## Expected Behavior

### Calibration:
- Tap "CALIBRATE" â†’ Shows calibration values
- Status changes from "Not calibrated" to "Calibrated: X:... Y:..."

### Phone Movement:
- Hold red button â†’ Status shows "ACTIVE"
- Move phone right â†’ Laser moves right
- Move phone left â†’ Laser moves left
- Move phone up â†’ Laser moves up
- Move phone down â†’ Laser moves down
- Release button â†’ Status shows "INACTIVE"

### Server Logs:
- Should show "ðŸ”´ Laser pointer moved to X%, Y%" messages
- Should show calibration and activation messages

## Troubleshooting

### If calibration doesn't work:
- Check Flutter console for "Calibrating laser pointer..." message
- Check server logs for calibration messages

### If phone movement doesn't work:
- Check Flutter console for "Starting laser pointer..." message
- Check server logs for "laser_pointer_move" commands
- Try the TEST button to verify server communication

### If laser doesn't appear in PowerPoint:
- Make sure PowerPoint is in presentation mode (F5)
- Try pressing Ctrl+L manually in PowerPoint
- Check if PowerPoint window is focused

## What to Report

Please tell me:
1. Do you see the "LASER POINTER" section in the Flutter app?
2. Does calibration work (shows calibration values)?
3. Does the TEST button work (laser moves to test positions)?
4. Does phone movement work (laser follows phone movement)?
5. What do you see in the server logs?
6. What do you see in the Flutter console?

This will help me identify exactly what's working and what's not!
