2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

   ```bash
   python slide_controller_server.py
   ```

2. **Note the IP address** displayed in the console (e.g., `192.168.1.100`)

3. **Open your presentation** in any presentation software:

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues
- Ensure both devices are on the same WiFi network
- Check if port 8080 is blocked by firewall
- Try restarting the server

### Presentation Not Responding
- Make sure the presentation software window is in focus
- Try clicking on the presentation window before using the remote
- Some software may require different keyboard shortcuts

### Permission Issues (macOS)
- Grant accessibility permissions to Terminal/Python in System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy > Accessibility

## Supported Presentation Software

âœ… **Tested and Working:**
- Microsoft PowerPoint
- Google Slides (Browser)
- LibreOffice Impress

## Custom Configuration

You can modify the keyboard shortcuts in the `SlideController` class:

```python
def next_slide(self):
    pyautogui.press('space')  # Change to space bar
    
def previous_slide(self):
    pyautogui.press('backspace')  # Change to backspace
```

## Security Note

This server only accepts connections from devices on your local network. It does not expose any system functionality beyond keyboard automation for presentations.
