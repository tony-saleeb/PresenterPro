# Touch-Based Laser Pointer Test Guide

## What's New

I've created a **simple touch-based laser pointer** that works exactly as you requested:

### **ðŸŽ¯ How It Works:**
1. **Tap the red circle button** â†’ Enables pointer mode
2. **In pointer mode**: 
   - Slide preview becomes **larger** (more space to touch)
   - **Touch anywhere** on the slide â†’ Laser moves to that position
   - **No swipe gestures** (can't change slides)
3. **Tap the button again** â†’ Disables pointer mode
4. **In normal mode**: 
   - Slide preview returns to normal size
   - **Swipe left/right** to change slides

## Step 1: Start the Server

```bash
cd python_server
python slide_controller_server.py
```

**Expected**: Server starts and shows "Server started successfully!"

## Step 2: Setup PowerPoint

1. **Open PowerPoint**
2. **Start a presentation** (F5)
3. **Make sure PowerPoint window is active/focused**

## Step 3: Connect Flutter App

1. **Open Flutter app**
2. **Connect to your server IP** (not localhost)
3. **Tap "Start" to begin presentation**

## Step 4: Test Touch-Based Laser Pointer

You should now see a **red circle button** in the footer area.

### **Testing Steps:**

1. **Normal Mode (Default)**:
   - Slide preview is normal size
   - Swipe left/right to change slides
   - Button is **grey**

2. **Enable Pointer Mode**:
   - **Tap the red circle button**
   - Button turns **red**
   - Slide preview becomes **larger** (less margin)
   - Swipe gestures are **disabled**

3. **Use Laser Pointer**:
   - **Touch anywhere** on the slide preview
   - Laser should move to that position
   - You should feel haptic feedback

4. **Disable Pointer Mode**:
   - **Tap the red button again**
   - Button turns **grey**
   - Slide preview returns to normal size
   - Swipe gestures are **re-enabled**

## Expected Behavior

### **Visual Changes:**
- **Button color**: Grey (off) â†” Red (on)
- **Slide size**: Normal â†” Larger (when in pointer mode)
- **Touch response**: Haptic feedback when touching slide

### **Server Logs:**
- Should show "ðŸ”´ Laser pointer moved to X%, Y%" messages
- Should show "laser_pointer_move" commands

### **PowerPoint:**
- Should show red laser dot moving to touched positions
- Laser should appear when you touch the slide

## Troubleshooting

### **If button doesn't appear:**
- Make sure you're in presentation mode
- Check that the server is connected

### **If touching doesn't work:**
- Make sure pointer mode is enabled (button is red)
- Check server logs for "laser_pointer_move" messages
- Try touching different areas of the slide

### **If laser doesn't appear in PowerPoint:**
- Make sure PowerPoint is in presentation mode (F5)
- Try pressing Ctrl+L manually in PowerPoint
- Check if PowerPoint window is focused

## What to Report

Please tell me:
1. Do you see the red circle button?
2. Does tapping it change the button color and slide size?
3. Does touching the slide move the laser pointer?
4. Can you switch between pointer mode and normal mode?
5. What do you see in the server logs?

This should work exactly as you requested! ðŸŽ¯âœ¨
